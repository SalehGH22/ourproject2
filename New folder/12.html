It widens students' knowledge and horizons, and meanwhile cultivates their independence and personalities.</p>

Since the reform and the policy of opening to the outside world, China has strengthened cooperation with many countries. As a result, the scientific and technological level has been improved very rapidly. However, compared with the developed countries in the world, we still have a very long way to go. Studying abroad provides opportunities to students, who can learn advanced knowledge and management experience, so as to enhance the scientific level in our country.</p>

       <p> Secondly, studying abroad can cultivate students' ability to live independently and their characters. Students have to deal with many problems when they study abroad. They have to learn how to be accustomed to a new environment and how to get along with the teachers and classmates. During their study, they can acquire some interpersonal skills.</p>

        <p>Finally, studying abroad can provide a good language environment to students and make it easy to pick up a language. Foreign language is a tool employed to communicate with each other. It can remove language barrier and make international cooperation much easier.</p>

       <p> However, "Every coin has its two sides". Studying abroad also brings about many disadvantages. Firstly, students will be confronted with so many psychological problems. They often feel lonely and helpless in a new environment. Furthermore, the tuition is very high, which is a very heavy financial burden to the average people.</p>
        <p>The worst feeling a student feels is being unwanted in a foriegn country and unfortunately it's common in some countries which make the student treated bad and Secondly, racism is the badest among the worst when a student being judged by his/her nationality or religion in a bad way .
        racism shoud stop all over the world and people should open up thier minds and judge a person by who he/she really is not by others mistakes. </p>
